Java front end is somewhat boring... No, DEFINITELY NOT complex and unappealing. It's just boring.
This project is what happens when a aspiring backend developer (beginner) with subpar front end sklls decides to do a project.
Using commands to run stuff is actually fun, new direction for projects. I wonder if incorporating Databases would be fun thing...
Something to consider... Enjoy!
